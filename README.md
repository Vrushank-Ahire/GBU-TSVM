**GBU-TSVM: Granular Ball Twin SVM with Universum Data**  
This repo contains the implementation of GBU-TSVM, a novel classifier that enhances Twin SVMs by leveraging granular ball computing and Universum data. The model boosts accuracy, noise resistance, and computational efficiency by representing data as hyper-balls and refining decision boundaries with contextual information. ðŸ“˜ [Read the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03375).
